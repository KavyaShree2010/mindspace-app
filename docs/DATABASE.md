# Business Rules

## Users

- Every email must be unique.
- Passwords must be hashed (bcryptjs, 12 salt rounds).
- Role cannot change after account creation unless performed by an administrator.
- Public registration creates STUDENT accounts only.
- Admin and Counsellor accounts are created via seed script.

---

## Students

- Can only edit their own profile.
- Can only access their own journals.
- Can only access their own mood logs.
- Cannot view other students' appointments.

---

## Counsellors

- Can only edit their own profile.
- Can only manage appointments assigned to them.
- Can only edit their own session notes.

---

## Appointments

- Cannot overlap for the same counsellor (enforced via API with time-range overlap query).
- Cannot be booked in the past (validated on both API and client).
- Only approved appointments can become completed.
- Every completed appointment must have one session note.
- Only PENDING appointments can be cancelled by the student.
- Students can only cancel their own appointments.
- Overlap check uses `startTime < new.endTime AND endTime > new.startTime` against existing PENDING/APPROVED appointments.
- Working hours: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM, 60-minute slots.
- Default status on creation: PENDING.
- Counsellors can only manage appointments assigned to them.

---

- Admins cannot read note contents.

---

## Mood Logs

---

## Journal Entries

- Private to the student.
- Support Create, Read, Update and Delete.

---

## Affirmations

- Only counsellors can create affirmations.
- Students can only view active affirmations.

---

# Suspension

`Suspension` stores `studentId`, `createdById`, `reason`, `startDate`, `endDate`,
optional `notes`, `status` (`ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, or `CANCELLED`), and the
standard created/updated timestamps. It relates to `User` for both the student
and the admin who created it. Suspension alerts link back to the record through
`Notification.suspensionId`.

There is no student-to-counsellor assignment relation in the current schema.
Therefore a new suspension notifies every active `COUNSELLOR`; edits and
resolution do not create duplicate alerts.

---

# Future Database Enhancements

- Notification table
- File attachments for session notes
- Emergency contact records
- Audit logs
- Activity history
- Calendar availability table
- Email reminder logs

---
